# E-commerce_website_expenditure
In this project, machine learning models were applied on the dataset which contained
information about the user and his activity on an e-commerce website, to predict the
amount spent by him on that website. After importing the data, data visualization techniques
were used for the purpose of data exploration. Dataset was divided into independent and
dependent variables and then the dataset was split into train and test data. Four machine
learning models namely Linear Regression model, Polynomial Regression model, Support
Vector Regression model and Random Forest Regression model were then applied on the
dataset. The parameters were then varied in each model to achieve least error. Finally, Linear
Regression model achieved the least mean squared error of 92.89. In order to use the
information gained in this study in real life practice, a GUI application was made using tkinter
of python which takes in parameters required to predict the amount spent by the user on an
e-commerce website, from the user and then displays it.
